\section{Conflict of Interest and Solutions}

\begin{itemize}
\item An employee starts a company that provides similar services to similar clients as those of her full-time employer. This is especially conflict of interest when an employer has had her sign a non-compete agreement.\\
    In this situation the employee must resign from the work he is currently pursuing. He/She shall not remain in the position that affects the company's and their best interests. 
\item An employee who is a member of a company employee selection team fails to disclose that he is related to a job candidate whom the company team is considering for a position.\\
    The disclosure of such information is a must, such that the hire they have made must be invalidated and subjected to a review. Further disciplinary action may be taken depending on the severity of the hire which has been made. 
\item A manager provides paid consulting services on the weekend to a company customer or supplier.\\
    The manager shall not provide such services in a ethical manner. He/She must stop doing such work, which has a direct conflicts in the best interests of both the company and them.
\item An employee works part-time in the evening for a company that makes a product that competes with the products of his full-time employer.\\
    The employee must be questioned and properly investigated, and be dismissed if found guilt. In the case he is found guilt, he must be further investigated for any sharing of business secrets of the full-time employer. He shall be dismissed from duty promptly after such investigation completes. He shall be placed in watch during such a investigation not to work with the competitor.
\item An HR director decides to investigate a formal charge of sexual harassment, using internal resources that she controls, against a fellow corporate executive whom she has known and worked with professionally for years. \\
    This would not constitute a conflict of interest if she hired an external employment law firm to conduct the investigation and recommend disciplinary measures.
\item A purchasing agent accepts trips and gifts from a vendor and then selects the vendor's products for purchase by the company.\\
    This is completely unethical for a purchase agent to do so. He/She shall be inquired further for their actions. The products chosen by the purchase agent must go under review for faults and cost variations. The Purchase agent should be issued a warning to avoid such in future scenarios.  
\item A trainer is paid to provide training classes that teach customers how to use the company's software products. He puts up a website that offers his same training on the products as a for-profit enterprise in his spare time. \\
    He shall not do such activities in a ethical manner. He should close such initiative and ask for a pay raise if he needs one.
